The following code example uses the AccessControl class 
to manage users access control to Organizations and databases


```javascript
/* Import terminusdb-client */
const TerminusClient = require("@terminusdb/terminusdb-client")
const AccessControl = require("./AccessControl")

/*Import the list of allowed actions */
const {ACTIONS} = require("./documentTemplate")

/*We are using TerminusDB for Authorization 
so we'll create all the User with a NO_KEY*/
const NO_KEY = "NO_KEY"

/*TerminusDB server host url*/
const serverHost ="http://localhost:6363"
```

Initialize the Terminusdb Client with the admin's credentials. Only the global admin can create Organizations and Users 

```javascript
const client = new TerminusClient.WOQLClient(serverHost, {user:"admin",key:"root"})
const accessControl = new AccessControl(client)

/*
* roles name
*/
const adminRole = "Role/admin"
const customRole =  "Role/reader"


```

Roles are sets of actions (permissions) that you can use to grant or restrict access to specific resource and operations.
Only the global admin can create Roles

```javascript
async function createCustomRole(){
    const label = "reader Role"
    try{
        const actions = [ACTIONS.SCHEMA_READ_ACCESS,
                         ACTIONS.COMMIT_READ_ACCESS,
                         ACTIONS.CLASS_FRAME,
                         ACTIONS.META_READ_ACCESS]
        const result = await accessControl.createRole(customRole,label,actions)
    }catch(err){
        console.log(err.message)
    }
}


```

The databases are create under an Organization. By linking a User to an Organization (capability), the User has access to all the Databases under this Organization

The list of all the users, organizations and databases that we are going to create

```javascript
const user__01 = "User__01"
const team__01 = "Team__01"

const user__02 = "User__02"
const user__03 = "User__03"

const team__02 = "Team__02"
const team__03 = "Team__03"

const db__01 = "Database__01"
const db__02 = "Database__02"


```

The database administrator (admin) can create such capability-role that lets another user to access a specific resource

A capability is a connection between Role and Resource (organizations or batabases)

```javascript
async function createUsersAndTeams(){
    try{
        /*
        *Create the new Organization Team__01 and the User User__01 with Role/admin to access this Organization
        *this means that the user has admin level of access for this Organization 
        *and for all the databases under this Organization
        *We are creating the User with NO_KEY, 
        *we are using TerminusDB for authorization.
        */
        await accessControl.createUserAndOrganization(team__01,user__01,adminRole)
        
        /*Create another Organization for the User User__01 with Role/admin*/
        await accessControl.createOrganization(team__03,user__01,adminRole)

        /*Add a new User user__02, assign the custom role Role/reader to access the Organization resource Team__01*/
        await accessControl.addNewUserToOrganization(team__01,user__02,customRole)
       
        /*Create the new Organization Team__02 and the User User__03 with Role/admin to access this Organization*/
        await accessControl.createUserAndOrganization(team__02,user__03,adminRole)

        /*assign the custom role (Role/reader) to the User User__03 over the Organization Team__01*/
        await accessControl.addExistsUserToOrganization(team__01,user__03,customRole)

    }catch(err){
        const errData = err.data || {}
        console.log(JSON.stringify(errData,null,4))
        console.log(err.message)
    }
}


```

Create a new TerminusDB client instance for the User__01 with NO_KEY setting. 
We assuming that the User is already logged in the system, the identity of the User is verified,
so we don't need to verify this again in TerminusDB.
The User can create a database under an Organization only if he has a Role that allow to "create_database"


```javascript
async function createDB(){
    try{
          const clientTeam01 = new TerminusClient.WOQLClient(serverHost, {user:user__01,key:NO_KEY,Organization:team__01})
          await clientTeam01.createDatabase(db__01, {label: db__01 , comment: "add db", schema: true}) 
          await clientTeam01.createDatabase(db__02, {label: db__02 , comment: "add db", schema: true}) 
    }catch(err){
        console.log(err.message)
    }
}


async function deleteDatabase (team,user,db){
    try{
        const clientTeam01 = new TerminusClient.WOQLClient(serverHost, {user:user__01,key:NO_KEY,Organization:team__01})
        await clientTeam01.deleteDatabase(db)
    }catch(err){
        console.log(`the database ${db} doesn't exists`)
    }
}
/*
* this is only for test purpose
* You must be very careful when you remove database, Organization/team and users
* the Organization have to be not related with nothing or you can not delete it.
* you have to remove all the databases before and all the users access Roles
*/
async function deleteUsersAndTeamsIfExists(){
    try{
        /*With this operation the Userstill exists is only not related with the Organization any more*/
        await accessControl.deleteUserFromOrg(team__01,user__02)
        await accessControl.deleteUserFromOrg(team__01,user__03)

        /*Important delete the databases before the Admin User 
        If no Admin user is related with the Organization 
        you can not remove the databases (you'll get an incorrect authorization error)*/
        await deleteDatabase(db__01)
        
        /*if a capability connect an user with an database,
        you have to remove the capability before the database*/
        await accessControl.deleteDatabaseRole(team__01,user__03,db__02)
        await deleteDatabase(db__02)       
        
        /*I remove the relationship between the Team__01 and the User__01*/
        await accessControl.deleteUserFromOrg(team__01,user__01)
        /*Now that the Organization is not related with nothing I can delete it*/
        await accessControl.deleteOrganization(team__01)

        await accessControl.deleteUserFromOrg(team__03,user__01)
        await accessControl.deleteOrganization(team__03)

        await accessControl.deleteUserFromOrg(team__02,user__03)
        await accessControl.deleteOrganization(team__02)

        /*The user has NO capability on any resource, so you can remove it*/
        await accessControl.deleteUser(user__01)
        await accessControl.deleteUser(user__02)
        await accessControl.deleteUser(user__03)
    }catch(err){
        console.log(err.message)
    }
}


async function run (){
    /*create a custom role*/
    await createCustomRole()
    /*create all the users and teams*/
    await createUsersAndTeams()

    await createDB()

    /*see the Team's Users Role*/
    const teamCapabilities = await accessControl.getListUserRoles(team__01)
    console.log(JSON.stringify(teamCapabilities,null,4))

    /*get all the database under this Organization*/
    const dbList = await accessControl.getDatabaseList(team__01)
    console.log(JSON.stringify(dbList,null,4))
    
```

the User has a role access level for the Organization and all the databases under this Organization
the system administrator (admin) can assign to a User a different role for a specific database
the role at database level works only if it is a higher role than the Organization access level

```javascript
    await accessControl.createDatabaseRole(team__01,user__03,db__02,adminRole)
    /*return the User roles at database level if setted*/
    const databaseCap= await accessControl.getUserDatabasesRoles(user__03)
    console.log(JSON.stringify(databaseCap,null,4))

    /*f you need to delete a User or an Organization look at this function*/
    /*await deleteUsersAndTeamsIfExists()*/  
}

run()


```
